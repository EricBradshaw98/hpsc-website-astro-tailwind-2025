```

## LinkedIn Posts (Build Inbound Interest)

Post 2-3x per week. Mix of educational + case studies.

### Post Type 1: Case Study

```
Just launched a website for a [Industry] company.

Before:
→ 3.4 second load time
→ 58 mobile score
→ Couldn't update without calling developer
→ 12 leads/month

After:
→ 0.8 second load time
→ 97 mobile score
→ Updates content themselves in 5 min
→ 31 leads/month

Timeline: 42 days
Investment: $35,000

The biggest win? They're no longer waiting 2 weeks for simple text changes.

Tech stack: Astro, WordPress headless CMS, Cloudflare Pages

[Industry] companies: Is your website helping you or holding you back?

[Link to case study]
```

---

### Post Type 2: Educational

```
Your website is losing 7% of visitors for every second it takes to load.

Most [industry] sites we audit:
• 3-5 second load times
• 60-75 mobile scores
• 40-50% bounce rate

Should be:
• <1 second load time
• 95+ mobile score
• <20% bounce rate

The difference? 2-3x more leads from the same traffic.

Free audit: Drop your website URL in comments (or DM if you're shy).

I'll run it through our tools and show you exactly what's slowing you down.
```

### Post Type 3: Controversial Take

```
Unpopular opinion:

You don't need a $100,000 website.

Most [industry] companies need:
→ 10-20 pages
→ Clean, mobile-first design
→ Sub-1-second load time
→ Easy content updates

This should cost $20k-$50k, not $100k+.

Agencies inflate prices with:
• Unnecessary custom features
• Months of "strategy" meetings
• Complex tech that breaks
• Ongoing vendor lock-in

You can get a better website for half the price in 1/3 the time.

Change my mind. ⬇️
```

---

### Post Type 4: Behind-the-Scenes

```
What a website build looks like (behind the scenes):

Week 1: Discovery
• Competitor research
• Content architecture
• Brand integration
• Design mockups

Week 2: Design Approval
• Client feedback
• Revisions
• Final design lock

Week 3-4: Development
• Build pages
• WordPress CMS setup
• Performance optimization
• Mobile testing

Week 4: Launch
• Training session
• QA testing
• Go live

Total: 30-60 days, fixed price.

No 6-month timelines. No surprise bills. No BS.

[Industry] companies: This is how it should work.
```

---

### Post Type 5: Metrics

```
Website metrics that actually matter:

❌ Don't care about:
• "Unique design"
• Awards
• Complex animations
• Fancy tech stack

✅ Do care about:
• Load time: <1 second
• Mobile score: 95+
• Conversion rate: 3-5%
• Google ranking: Page 1

Your website is a tool, not art.

It should make you money, not win design contests.

What metrics are you tracking?

## LinkedIn Sales Navigator Search Filters

### Search 1: Decision Makers

- **Title**: Owner, CEO, Founder, President, Marketing Director, VP Marketing
- **Company size**: 10-500 employees
- **Industry**: [Your target industries]
- **Geography**: [Your target area]
- **Posted on LinkedIn**: Past 30 days (shows they're active)

### Search 2: Growth Companies

- **Title**: Same as above

- **Not connected to**: You
- **Geography**: [Your target area]

---

## Automation Warning

**DO NOT use automation tools** (Phantombuster, Dripify, etc.) for:
- Sending connection requests
- Sending messages
- Viewing profiles

LinkedIn will ban you. Do everything manually.

**Acceptable automation:**
- Spreadsheet to track outreach
- Calendar tool (Calendly, etc.)
- CRM to log conversations

---

## Best Practices

### Do's:
- ✅ Personalize every connection request
- ✅ Wait 1-2 hours after connection before messaging
- ✅ Reference something specific about their company
- ✅ Lead with value, not pitch
- ✅ Use your profile as a sales page
- ✅ Post consistently (2-3x/week)
- ✅ Engage with others' content (5-10 comments/day)

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Send generic "I can help you" messages
- ❌ Pitch immediately after connecting
- ❌ Use automation tools
- ❌ Send InMail to non-connections (waste of credits)
- ❌ Only post about yourself (share industry insights too)
- ❌ Give up after 1-2 messages (follow up!)

## Response Handling

### When They Reply Positively:

```
Awesome! Let me send you a quick 15-min calendar link.

Before the call, what's the #1 thing you'd want to improve about your current website?

[Calendar Link]

Looking forward to it!
```

### When They Ask for Pricing:

```
Great question - depends on scope, but most [industry] builds are $20k-50k.

Rather than give you a generic range, let me show you 2-3 examples similar to what you'd need, and you can tell me which feels right.

[Calendar Link] - 15 minutes, I'll share screens.

That work?
```

### When They Say "Not Right Now":

```
No problem at all! Mind if I ask - is it timing, budget, or just not a priority?

Either way, I'll check back in a few months. Cool if I send you our case studies when we publish them? Some good [industry] examples coming up.

And if anything changes or you just want to see what we'd recommend for [Company Name], I'm around.

[Your Name]
```

### When They Ask "Can You Send Info?":

```
Absolutely - but tbh, everything I'd send is stuff you've probably seen from other agencies (portfolio, pricing, timeline).

What would be more useful: 15-minute call where I show you exactly what I'd build for [Company Name] specifically?

I can screen-share 2-3 examples similar to your needs, and you can tell me if it's close or way off.

[Calendar Link]

If you prefer email, I can send over some case studies - just let me know what industry/size company is most relevant to you.
```
