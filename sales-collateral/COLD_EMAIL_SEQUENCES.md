# Cold Email Sequences

## Sequence 1: The "Slow Website" Sequence

### Email 1 - The Problem (Day 0)

**Subject**: Your website is costing you customers

Hi [First Name],

I was looking at [Company Name]'s website and noticed it takes 3+ seconds to load on mobile.

For every second of delay, you lose 7% of visitors. At 3 seconds, that's 21% of potential customers leaving before they even see your services.

Quick question: How many leads per month would an extra 21% give you?

We specialize in building lightning-fast websites for [industry] companies - sub-1-second load times, guaranteed.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Email 2 - The Proof (Day 3)

**Subject**: Re: Your website is costing you customers

[First Name],

Not sure if you saw my last email about your site's load time.

I don't usually follow up with case studies, but thought this might be relevant:

**[Similar Company] - [Industry]**
- Before: 3.2 second load time → After: 0.7 seconds
- Before: 62 mobile score → After: 98
- Result: 43% more lead form submissions

Same industry, same problem, measurable results.

Here's the before/after: [link to case study]

## Sequence 2: The "Can't Update Website" Sequence

### Email 1 - The Frustration (Day 0)

**Subject**: Still emailing your developer to update your website?

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How long does it take to update something on your website?

Most [industry] companies we talk to say 2-3 weeks (and $200-500) just to change some text or swap an image.

We build websites where YOU can update anything in 5 minutes. No developer, no waiting, no extra fees.

WordPress backend, but enterprise-level performance and security.

Worth seeing a demo?

### Email 3 - The Cost Comparison (Day 7)

**Subject**: You're overpaying for web updates

[First Name],

Did the math on what most companies waste on web updates:

**Current Approach:**
- Developer: $150/hour
- Small updates: 1-2 hours = $200-300 each
- Monthly average: 2-3 updates = $400-900/month
- Annual: $4,800 - $10,800

**Our Approach:**
- Unlimited updates: You do them yourself in 5 min
- Monthly support: $500 (hosting + security + backup)
- Annual: $6,000

**You save**: $4,800/year minimum (and no more waiting)

Plus, we rebuild your entire site for $20k-50k (one-time), not the $80k+ agencies charge.

## Sequence 3: The "Industry Specific" Sequence

### Email 1 - The Relevance (Day 0)

**Subject**: Websites for [Industry] companies

Hi [First Name],

We just finished a website for [Competitor/Similar Company] - [Industry].

Their old site was hurting them:
- Looked outdated (last redesign 2018)
- Slow on mobile (3+ second load)
- Couldn't showcase their work effectively

New site launched 3 weeks ago. Already seeing:
- 40% more contact form submissions
- 2.5x more time on site
- First page Google rankings for "[industry keyword]"

Worth a 15-minute walkthrough to see if we can do the same for [Company Name]?

### Email 2 - The Specific Problem (Day 3)

**Subject**: Re: Websites for [Industry] companies

[First Name],

One thing I noticed on [Company Name]'s site:

[Specific, genuine observation about their site]
- Missing: [specific feature competitors have]
- Opportunity: [specific improvement you'd make]
- Risk: [what they're losing by not having this]

Not trying to be critical - just see this pattern with [industry] companies all the time.

We specialize in this exact fix for [industry]. Takes 30-45 days, fixed price.

### Email 3 - The Industry Trend (Day 7)

**Subject**: [Industry] is moving fast (is your site keeping up?)

[First Name],

Noticed a trend in [industry]:

Your competitors ([Competitor 1], [Competitor 2]) all updated their websites in the last 6 months.

They're investing in:
- Mobile-first design (70% of traffic)
- Sub-1-second load times
- Easy content updates (WordPress)
- Modern, trust-building design

Meanwhile, [Company Name]'s site looks like it hasn't changed since [year based on copyright].

No judgment - just know that buyers notice. And in [industry], trust = conversions.

We can fix this in 30-60 days for $20k-50k (not the $100k+ agencies charge).

## Sequence 4: The "Agency Left Us" Sequence

### Email 1 - The Empathy (Day 0)

**Subject**: Need someone reliable for your website?

Hi [First Name],

Every [industry] company we work with has the same story:

"Our last agency built the site, then disappeared. Now we can't get anyone to update it or fix issues."

Sound familiar?

We're the opposite:
- Fixed-price builds (no surprise bills)
- 30-60 day delivery (not 6 months)
- Ongoing support ($500/month with guaranteed response times)
- You own everything (no vendor lock-in)

We don't disappear after launch. That's when the real work begins.

Worth 15 minutes?

### Email 3 - The Transition Plan (Day 7)

**Subject**: Getting you unstuck from your current situation

[First Name],

Last email - wanted to address the elephant in the room:

"We already have a website (even if it's not great). How hard is it to switch?"

**Our transition process:**

1. **Discovery** (Week 1): Export all your current content
2. **Migration** (Week 2): Move to new platform, preserve SEO
3. **Redesign** (Week 3-4): Make it modern and fast
4. **Launch** (Week 4): Switch DNS, redirect old URLs

Zero downtime. Zero lost Google rankings. Zero stress.

We've done this 50+ times for companies leaving Wix, WordPress, Squarespace, or custom builds.

## Email Best Practices

### Do's:
- ✅ Personalize first line (mention their company specifically)
- ✅ Keep under 125 words
- ✅ One clear CTA (calendar link)
- ✅ Specific numbers/metrics from case studies
- ✅ Send Tuesday-Thursday, 8-11am local time
- ✅ Use plain text (no HTML, no images)

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Generic "I can help you" language
- ❌ Multiple CTAs or links
- ❌ Attachments (gets flagged as spam)
- ❌ Talking about yourself first
- ❌ Walls of text
- ❌ Sending Monday morning or Friday afternoon

### Subject Line Framework:

**Good:**
- "Your website is costing you customers"
- "Still emailing your developer to update your website?"
- "[Competitor] just updated their website"
- "15-minute website audit for [Company]"

**Bad:**
- "Web design services"
- "Can I help you?"
- "Quick question"
- "Following up"

### Sending Schedule:

- Email 1: Day 0
- Email 2: Day 3 (if no response)
- Email 3: Day 7 (if no response)
- Stop after Email 3 (don't be annoying)

### Tracking:

Use tool like Mailtrack, HubSpot, or Lemlist to track:
- Open rate (aim for 40%+)
- Reply rate (aim for 2-5%)
- Click rate on calendar link (aim for 1-3%)

### Sample Metrics:

200 emails/day × 20 days = 4,000 emails/month

**Expected results:**
- Open rate: 45% = 1,800 opens
- Reply rate: 3% = 120 replies
- Positive replies: 25% = 30 qualified leads
- Calls booked: 50% = 15 calls
- Proposals sent: 60% = 9 proposals
- Deals closed: 30% = 2-3 new clients

**Cost:** $100/month (email tool) + 2 hours/day = Extremely high ROI
