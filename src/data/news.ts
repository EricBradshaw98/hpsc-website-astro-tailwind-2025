			<p>A comprehensive deep energy retrofit transformed a typical 1970s Vancouver home into a net-zero energy residence. Here's how it was done.</p>

			<h2>The Challenge</h2>
			<p>The 1,800 sq ft home had minimal insulation, single-pane windows, and an aging gas furnace.</p>

			<h2>The Solution</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Exterior insulation and new siding (R-30 walls)</li>
				<li>Roof insulation upgrade (R-60)</li>
				<li>Triple-pane windows throughout</li>
				<li>Air-source heat pump for heating/cooling</li>
				<li>Heat pump water heater</li>
				<li>8 kW solar PV system</li>

			<h2>The Results</h2>
			<p>Energy consumption reduced by 85%, with remaining needs met by solar production. Total project cost: $120,000 with rebates bringing it down to $85,000.</p>
